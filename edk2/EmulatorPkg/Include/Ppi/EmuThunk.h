/*++

Routine Description:
  This service is called from Index == 0 until it returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  It allows discontinuous memory regions to be supported by the emulator.

Arguments:
  Index      - Which memory region to use
  MemoryBase - Return Base address of memory region
  MemorySize - Return size in bytes of the memory region

Returns:
  EFI_SUCCESS - If memory region was mapped
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED - If Index is not supported

/*++

Routine Description:
  Return the FD Size and base address. Since the FD is loaded from a
  file into host memory only the SEC will know it's address.

Arguments:
  Index  - Which FD, starts at zero.
  FdSize - Size of the FD in bytes
  FdBase - Start address of the FD. Assume it points to an FV Header
  FixUp  - Difference between actual FD address and build address

Returns:
  EFI_SUCCESS     - Return the Base address and size of the FV
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED - Index does nto map to an FD in the system

Routine Description:
  Loads and relocates a PE/COFF image into memory.

Arguments:
  Pe32Data         - The base address of the PE/COFF file that is to be loaded and relocated
  ImageAddress     - The base address of the relocated PE/COFF image
  ImageSize        - The size of the relocated PE/COFF image
  EntryPoint       - The entry point of the relocated PE/COFF image

Returns:
  EFI_SUCCESS   - The file was loaded and relocated
  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES - There was not enough memory to load and relocate the PE/COFF file
