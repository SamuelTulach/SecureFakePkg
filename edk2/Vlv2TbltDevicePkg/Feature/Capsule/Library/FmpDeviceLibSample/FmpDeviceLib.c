Routine Description:

    This is a function used to read the current firmware from the device into memory.
    This is an optional function and can return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.  This is useful for

Arguments:

    ImageSize           -- Size of the Image buffer.

Return Value:

    EFI_STATUS code.

/**
Updates the firmware image of the device.

This function updates the hardware with the new firmware image.
This function returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.
If the firmware image is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
- Validate the image is a supported image for this device.  The function returns EFI_ABORTED if
the image is unsupported.  The function can optionally provide more detailed information on
why the image is not a supported image.
- Validate the data from VendorCode if not null.  Image validation must be performed before
VendorCode data validation.  VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image
validation failed.  The function returns EFI_ABORTED if the data is invalid.

VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy.  Null if
the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy.  As an example, vendor can implement
a policy to allow an option to force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new
firmware image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image checksum.
Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image and render the device to be
non-functional should be encoded in the image itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.
AbortReason enables vendor to have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort
reason to the caller.

@param[in]  Image              Points to the new image.
@param[in]  ImageSize          Size of the new image in bytes.
@param[in]  VendorCode         This enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy.
Null indicates the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy.
@param[in]  Progress           A function used by the driver to report the progress of the firmware update.
@param[in]  CapsuleFwVersion   FMP Payload Header version of the image
@param[out] AbortReason        A pointer to a pointer to a null-terminated string providing more
details for the aborted operation. The buffer is allocated by this function
with AllocatePool(), and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with a
call to FreePool().

@retval EFI_SUCCESS            The device was successfully updated with the new image.
@retval EFI_ABORTED            The operation is aborted.
@retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  The Image was NULL.
@retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED        The operation is not supported.
