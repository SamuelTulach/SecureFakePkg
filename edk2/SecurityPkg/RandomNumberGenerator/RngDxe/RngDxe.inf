#  Produces the UEFI Random Number Generator protocol
#
#  This module will leverage Intel Secure Key technology to produce the Random
#  Number Generator protocol, which is used to provide high-quality random numbers
#  for use in applications, or entropy for seeding other random number generators.
#  Refer to http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number
#  -generator-drng-software-implementation-guide/ for more information about Intel
#  Secure Key technology.
