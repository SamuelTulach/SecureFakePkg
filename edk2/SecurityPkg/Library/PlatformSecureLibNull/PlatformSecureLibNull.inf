## @file
#  NULL platform secure library instance that alway returns TRUE for a user physical present
#
#  NULL PlatformSecureLib instance does NOT really detect whether a physical present
#  user exists but returns TRUE directly. This instance can be used to verify security
#  related features during platform enabling and development. It should be replaced
#  by a platform-specific method(e.g. Button pressed) in a real platform for product.
