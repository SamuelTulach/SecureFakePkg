#  Provides security service for TPM 1.2 measured boot
#
#  This library instance hooks LoadImage() API to measure every image that
#  is not measured in PEI phase. And, it will also measure GPT partition.
#
#  Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
#  This library will have external input - PE/COFF image and GPT partition.
#  This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issues such
#  as buffer overflow or integer overflow.
