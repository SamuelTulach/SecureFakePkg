// This library instance hooks LoadImage() API to measure every image that
// is not measured in PEI phase. And, it will also measure GPT partition.
//
// Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
// This library will have external input - PE/COFF image and GPT partition.
// This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issues such
// as buffer overflow or integer overflow.
