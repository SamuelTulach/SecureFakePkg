/**
  Returns information about a deferred image.

  This function returns information about a single deferred image. The deferred images are
  numbered consecutively, starting with 0.  If there is no image which corresponds to
  ImageIndex, then EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned. All deferred images may be returned by
  iteratively calling this function until EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.
  Image may be NULL and ImageSize set to 0 if the decision to defer execution was made
  because of the location of the executable image, rather than its actual contents.

  @param[in]  This              Points to this instance of the EFI_DEFERRED_IMAGE_LOAD_PROTOCOL.
  @param[in]  ImageIndex        Zero-based index of the deferred index.
  @param[out] ImageDevicePath   On return, points to a pointer to the device path of the image.
                                The device path should not be freed by the caller.
  @param[out] Image             On return, points to the first byte of the image or NULL if the
                                image is not available. The image should not be freed by the caller
                                unless LoadImage() has been called successfully.
  @param[out] ImageSize         On return, the size of the image, or 0 if the image is not available.
  @param[out] BootOption        On return, points to TRUE if the image was intended as a boot option
                                or FALSE if it was not intended as a boot option.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Image information returned successfully.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         ImageIndex does not refer to a valid image.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ImageDevicePath is NULL or Image is NULL or ImageSize is NULL or
                                BootOption is NULL.
