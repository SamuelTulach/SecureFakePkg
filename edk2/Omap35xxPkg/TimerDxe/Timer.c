  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the

  interrupt fires.

/**
  Interface stucture for the Timer Architectural Protocol.

  @par Protocol Description:
  This protocol provides the services to initialize a periodic timer
  interrupt, and to register a handler that is called each time the timer
  interrupt fires.  It may also provide a service to adjust the rate of the
  periodic timer interrupt.  When a timer interrupt occurs, the handler is
  passed the amount of time that has passed since the previous timer
  interrupt.

  @param RegisterHandler
  Registers a handler that will be called each time the
  timer interrupt fires.  TimerPeriod defines the minimum
  time between timer interrupts, so TimerPeriod will also
  be the minimum time between calls to the registered
  handler.

  @param SetTimerPeriod
  Sets the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
  This function is optional, and may return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  If this function is supported, then the timer period will
  be rounded up to the nearest supported timer period.


  @param GetTimerPeriod
  Retrieves the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.

  @param GenerateSoftInterrupt
  Generates a soft timer interrupt that simulates the firing of
  the timer interrupt. This service can be used to invoke the   registered handler if the timer interrupt has been masked for
  a period of time.
