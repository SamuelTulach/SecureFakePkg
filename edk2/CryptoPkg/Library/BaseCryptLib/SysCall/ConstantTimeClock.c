/** @file
  C Run-Time Libraries (CRT) Time Management Routines Wrapper Implementation
  for OpenSSL-based Cryptographic Library.

  This C file implements constant time value for time() and NULL for gmtime()
  thus should not be used in library instances which require functionality
  of following APIs which need system time support:
  1)  RsaGenerateKey
  2)  RsaCheckKey
  3)  RsaPkcs1Sign
  4)  Pkcs7Sign
  5)  DhGenerateParameter
  6)  DhGenerateKey
