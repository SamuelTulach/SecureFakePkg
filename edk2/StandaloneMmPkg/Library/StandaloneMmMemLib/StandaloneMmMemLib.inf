## @file
#  Instance of MM memory check library.
#
#  MM memory check library library implementation. This library consumes MM_ACCESS_PROTOCOL
#  to get MMRAM information. In order to use this library instance, the platform should produce
#  all MMRAM range via MM_ACCESS_PROTOCOL, including the range for firmware (like MM Core
#  and MM driver) and/or specific dedicated hardware.
