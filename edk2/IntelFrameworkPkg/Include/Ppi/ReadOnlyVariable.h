/** @file
  This file declares the Read-only Variable Service PPI, which is required by the framework spec.

  These services provide a lightweight, read-only variant of the full EFI variable services. The
  reason that these services are read-only is to reduce the complexity of flash management. Also,
  some implementation of the PEI may use the same physical flash part for variable and PEIM
  storage. As such, a write command to certain technologies would alter the contents of the entire part,
  making the PEIM execution in the original position not follow the required flow.
