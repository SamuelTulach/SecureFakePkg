  Executes an SMBus operation to an SMBus controller.

  @param[in]      PeiServices   A pointer to the system PEI Services Table.
  @param[in]      This          A pointer to the EFI_PEI_SMBUS_PPI instance.
  @param[in]      SlaveAddress  The SMBUS hardware address to which the SMBUS
                                device is preassigned or allocated.
  @param[in]      Command       This command is transmitted by the SMBus host
                                controller to the SMBus slave device, and the
                                interpretation is SMBus slave device specific.
  @param[in]      Operation     Signifies which particular SMBus hardware protocol
                                instance to use to execute the SMBus transactions.
  @param[in]      PecCheck      Defines if Packet Error Code (PEC) checking is
                                required for this operation.
  @param[in, out] Length        The number of bytes for this operation.
  @param[in, out] Buffer        Contains the value of data to execute to the SMBus
                                slave device.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The last data that was returned from the access
                                matched the poll exit criteria.
  @retval EFI_CRC_ERROR         The checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect).
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           Timeout expired before the operation was completed.
                                Timeout is determined by the SMBus host controller device.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be completed
                                due to a lack of resources.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The request was not completed because a failure
                                was recorded in the Host Status Register bit.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The operation is not defined in EFI_SMBUS_OPERATION.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Length/Buffer is NULL for operations except for
                                EfiSmbusQuickRead and EfiSmbusQuickWrite. Length
                                is outside the range of valid values.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The SMBus operation or PEC is not supported.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  Buffer is not sufficient for this operation.
