/**
  The function is used to retrieve a section from within a section file.
  It will retrieve both encapsulation sections and leaf sections in their entirety,
  exclusive of the section header.

  @param PeiServices            The pointer to the PEI Services Table.
  @param This                   Indicates the calling context
  @param SectionType            The pointer to an EFI_SECTION_TYPE. If
                                SectionType == NULL, the contents of the entire
                                section are returned in Buffer. If SectionType
                                is not NULL, only the requested section is returned.
  @param SectionDefinitionGuid  The pointer to an EFI_GUID.
                                If SectionType == EFI_SECTION_GUID_DEFINED,
                                SectionDefinitionGuid indicates for which section
                                GUID to search.  If SectionType != EFI_SECTION_GUID_DEFINED,
                                SectionDefinitionGuid is unused and is ignored.
  @param SectionInstance        If SectionType is not NULL, indicates which
                                instance of the requested section type to return.
  @param Buffer                 The pointer to a pointer to a buffer in which the
                                section contents are returned.
  @param BufferSize             A pointer to a caller-allocated UINT32. On input,
                                *BufferSize indicates the size in bytes of the
                                memory region pointed to by Buffer. On output,
                                *BufferSize contains the number of bytes required
                                to read the section.
  @param AuthenticationStatus   A pointer to a caller-allocated UINT32 in
                                which any metadata from encapsulating GUID-defined
                                sections is returned.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The section was successfully processed, and the section
                                contents were returned in Buffer.
  @retval EFI_PROTOCOL_ERROR    A GUID-defined section was encountered in
                                the file with its EFI_GUIDED_SECTION_PROCESSING_REQUIRED
                                bit set, but there was no corresponding GUIDed
                                Section Extraction Protocol in the handle database.
                                *Buffer is unmodified.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The requested section does not exist.*Buffer is
                                unmodified.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The system has insufficient resources to process
                                the request.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER The SectionStreamHandle does not exist.
  @retval EFI_WARN_TOO_SMALL    The size of the input buffer is insufficient to
                                contain the requested section. The input buffer
                                is filled and contents are section contents are
                                truncated.
