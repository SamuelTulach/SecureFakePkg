/**
  Writes the specified number of bytes from the input buffer to the block.

  The Write() function writes the specified number of bytes from
  the provided buffer to the specified block and offset. If the
  firmware volume is sticky write, the caller must ensure that
  all the bits of the specified range to write are in the
  EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state before calling the Write()
  function, or else the result will be unpredictable. This
  unpredictability arises because, for a sticky-write firmware
  volume, a write may negate a bit in the EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY
  state but cannot flip it back again. In general, before
  calling the Write() function, the caller should call the
  EraseBlocks() function first to erase the specified block to
  write. A block erase cycle will transition bits from the
  (NOT)EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state back to the
  EFI_FVB_ERASE_POLARITY state. Implementors should note
  that the firmware volume might be in the WriteDisabled
  state. If it is in this state, the Write() function must
  return the status code EFI_ACCESS_DENIED without modifying the
  contents of the firmware volume. The Write() function must
  also prevent spanning block boundaries. If a write is
  requested that spans a block boundary, the write must store up
  to the boundary but not beyond. The output parameter NumBytes
  must be set to correctly indicate the number of bytes actually
  written. The caller must be aware that a write may be
  partially completed. All writes, partial or otherwise, must be
  fully flushed to the hardware before the Write() service
  returns.

  @param This     Indicates the FRAMEWORK_EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_BLOCK_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param Lba      The starting logical block index to write to.

  @param Buffer   The pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that

/**
  Erases and initializes a firmware volume block.

  The EraseBlocks() function erases one or more blocks as denoted
  by the variable argument list. The entire parameter list of
  blocks must be verified before erasing any blocks. If a block is
  requested that does not exist within the associated firmware
  volume (it has a larger index than the last block of the
  firmware volume), the EraseBlocks() function must return the
  status code EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER without modifying the contents
  of the firmware volume. Implementors should note that
  the firmware volume might be in the WriteDisabled state. If it
  is in this state, the EraseBlocks() function must return the
  status code EFI_ACCESS_DENIED without modifying the contents of
  the firmware volume. All calls to EraseBlocks() must be fully
  flushed to the hardware before the EraseBlocks() service
  returns.

  @param This   Indicates the FRAMEWORK_EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_BLOCK_PROTOCOL
                instance.

  @param ...    A list of tuples.
                Each tuple describes a range of LBAs to erase
                and consists of the following:
                - An EFI_LBA that indicates the starting LBA
                - A UINTN that indicates the number of blocks to

                The list is terminated with an
                EFI_LBA_LIST_TERMINATOR. For example, the
                following indicates that two ranges of blocks
                (5-7 and 10-11) are to be erased: EraseBlocks
                (This, 5, 3, 10, 2, EFI_LBA_LIST_TERMINATOR);

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS The erase request successfully
                      completed.

  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED   The firmware volume is in the

                            The firmware device may have been
                            partially erased.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of the LBAs listed
