/** @file
  This file declares the SMM Control abstraction protocol.
  This protocol is used to initiate SMI/PMI activations. This protocol could be published by either:
  - A processor driver to abstract the SMI/PMI IPI
  - The driver that abstracts the ASIC that is supporting the APM port, such as the ICH in an
  Intel chipset
  Because of the possibility of performing SMI or PMI IPI transactions, the ability to generate this
  event from a platform chipset agent is an optional capability for both IA-32 and Itanium-based
  systems.

  This protocol could be published by either:

    - The driver that abstracts the ASIC that is supporting the APM port, such as the ICH in an Intel chipset.
  Because of the possibility of performing SMI or PMI IPI transactions, the ability to generate this.

  The EFI_SMM_CONTROL_PROTOCOL is used by the platform chipset or processor driver. This
  protocol is usable both in boot services and at runtime. The runtime aspect enables an
  implementation of EFI_SMM_BASE_PROTOCOL.Communicate() to layer upon this service
  and provide an SMI callback from a general EFI runtime driver.
  This protocol provides an abstraction to the platform hardware that generates an
  SMI or PMI. There are often I/O ports that, when accessed, will engender the SMI or PMI.
  Also, this hardware optionally supports the periodic genearation of these signals.
