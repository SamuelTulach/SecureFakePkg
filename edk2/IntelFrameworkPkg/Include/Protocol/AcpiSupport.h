/** @file
  This protocol provides some basic services to support publishing ACPI system tables. The
  services handle many of the more mundane tasks that are required to publish a set of tables. The
  services will:
        - Generate common tables.
  - Update the table links.
  - Ensure that tables are properly aligned and use correct types of memory.
  - Update checksum values and IDs.
  - Complete the final installation of the tables.
