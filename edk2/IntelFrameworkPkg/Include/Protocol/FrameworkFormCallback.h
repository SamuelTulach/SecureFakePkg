/** @file
  The EFI_FORM_CALLBACK_PROTOCOL is the defined interface for access to custom
  NV storage devices and for communication of user selections in a more
  interactive environment.  This protocol should be published by hardware
  specific drivers that want to export access to custom hardware storage or
  publish IFR that need to call back the original driver.
