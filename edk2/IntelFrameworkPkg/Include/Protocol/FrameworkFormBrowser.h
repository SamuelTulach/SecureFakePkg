/** @file
  The EFI_FORM_BROWSER_PROTOCOL is the interface to the EFI
  Configuration Driver.  This interface enables the caller to direct the
  configuration driver to use either the HII database or the passed-in
  packet of data.  This will also allow the caller to post messages
  into the configuration drivers internal mailbox.

/**
  Provides direction to the configuration driver whether to use the HII
  database or a passed-in set of data. This function also establishes a
  pointer to the calling driver's callback interface.

  @param  This                  A pointer to the EFI_FORM_BROWSER_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  UseDatabase           Determines whether the HII database is to be
                                used to gather information. If the value is FALSE,
                                the configuration driver will get the information
                                provided in the passed-in Packet parameters.
  @param  Handle                A pointer to an array of HII handles to display.
                                This value should correspond to the value of the
                                HII form package that is required to be displayed.
  @param  HandleCount           The number of handles in the array specified by Handle.
  @param  Packet                A pointer to a set of data containing pointers to IFR
                                and/or string data.
  @param  CallbackHandle        The handle to the driver's callback interface.
                                This parameter is used only when the UseDatabase
                                parameter is FALSE and an application wants to
                                register a callback with the browser.
  @param  NvMapOverride         This buffer is used only when there is no NV variable
                                to define the current settings and the caller needs
                                to provide to the browser the current settings for
                                the "fake" NV variable.
  @param  ScreenDimensions      Allows the browser to be called so that it occupies
                                a portion of the physical screen instead of dynamically
                                determining the screen dimensions.
  @param  ResetRequired         This BOOLEAN value denotes whether a reset is required
                                based on the data that might have been changed.
                                The ResetRequired parameter is primarily applicable
                                for configuration applications, and is an
                                optional parameter.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The function completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The variable was not found.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  The DataSize is too small for the result.
                                DataSize has been updated with the size needed to
                                complete the request.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One of the parameters has an invalid value.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The variable could not be saved due to a hardware failure.

                                to construct the dialog box.
