/** @file
  This file declares the hardware-device class GUIDs that may be used by the
  PEIM that produces the Virtual Block I/O PPI.

  These GUIDs are hardware-device class GUIDs that would be imported only by the
  Virtual Block I/O PEIM.  This virtual PEIM imports only the actual Block I/O
  PPIs from the device-class ones listed here and published a single instance of
  the Block I/O PPI for consumption by the File System PEIM.  In the parlance of
  the Framework DXE software stack, this Virtual Block I/O PEIM is actually
  embodying the functionality of the partition driver.  Thsi Virtual Block I/O
  PEIM has to multiple the multiple possible instances of Block I/O and also know
  how to parse at least El Torito for CD-ROM, and perhaps Master Boot Record(MBR)
  and GUID Partition Table(GPT) in the future.
