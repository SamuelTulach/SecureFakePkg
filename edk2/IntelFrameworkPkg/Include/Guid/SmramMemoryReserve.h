  Definition of GUIDed HOB for reserving SMRAM regions.

  This file defines:
  * the GUID used to identify the GUID HOB for reserving SMRAM regions.
  * the data structure of SMRAM descriptor to describe SMRAM candidate regions
  * values of state of SMRAM candidate regions
  * the GUID specific data structure of HOB for reserving SMRAM regions.
  This GUIDed HOB can be used to convey the existence of the T-SEG reservation and H-SEG usage
