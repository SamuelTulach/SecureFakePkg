/**
  Executes an SMBus operation to an SMBus controller.

  This function provides a standard way to execute Smbus script
  as defined in the SmBus Specification. The data can either be of
  the Length byte, word, or a block of data.

  @param  SmbusOperation  Signifies which particular SMBus hardware protocol instance that it will use to
                          execute the SMBus transactions.
  @param  SmBusAddress    Address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                          SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param  Length          Signifies the number of bytes that this operation will do. The maximum number of
                          bytes can be revision specific and operation specific.
  @param  Buffer          Contains the value of data to execute to the SMBus slave device. Not all operations
                          require this argument. The length of this buffer is identified by Length.
  @param  Status          Return status for the executed command.
                          This is an optional parameter and may be NULL.

  @return The actual number of bytes that are executed for this operation.
