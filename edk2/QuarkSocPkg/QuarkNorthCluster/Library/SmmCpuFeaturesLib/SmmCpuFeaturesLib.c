/**
  Called during the very first SMI into System Management Mode to initialize
  CPU features, including SMBASE, for the currently executing CPU.  Since this
  is the first SMI, the SMRAM Save State Map is at the default address of
  SMM_DEFAULT_SMBASE + SMRAM_SAVE_STATE_MAP_OFFSET.  The currently executing
  CPU is specified by CpuIndex and CpuIndex can be used to access information
  about the currently executing CPU in the ProcessorInfo array and the
  HotPlugCpuData data structure.

  @param[in] CpuIndex        The index of the CPU to initialize.  The value
                             must be between 0 and the NumberOfCpus field in
                             the System Management System Table (SMST).

                             Management Mode initialization.
  @param[in] ProcessorInfo   Pointer to an array of EFI_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION
                             structures.  ProcessorInfo[CpuIndex] contains the
                             information for the currently executing CPU.
  @param[in] CpuHotPlugData  Pointer to the CPU_HOT_PLUG_DATA structure that
                             contains the ApidId and SmBase arrays.
