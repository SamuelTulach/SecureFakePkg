// The EhciDxe driver is responsible for managing the behavior of EHCI controller.
//
// It implements the interfaces of monitoring the status of all ports and transferring
// Control, Bulk, Interrupt and Isochronous requests to Usb2.0 device.
//
// Note that EhciDxe driver is enhanced to guarantee that the EHCI controller get attached
// to the EHCI controller before the UHCI driver attaches to the companion UHCI controller.
// This way avoids the control transfer on a shared port between EHCI and companion host
// controller when UHCI gets attached earlier than EHCI and a USB 2.0 device inserts.
