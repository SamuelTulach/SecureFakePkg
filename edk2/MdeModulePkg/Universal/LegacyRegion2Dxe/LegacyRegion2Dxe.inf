#  Produces the Legacy Region 2 Protocol.
#
#  This generic implementation of the Legacy Region 2 Protocol does not actually
#  perform any lock/unlock operations.  This module may be used on platforms
#  that do not provide HW locking of the legacy memory regions.  It can also
#  be used as a template driver for implementing the Legacy Region 2 Protocol on
#  a platform that does support HW locking of the legacy memory regions.
#
#  Note: This module does not fully comply with PI Specification of Legacy Region 2
#  Protocol. For Lock/UnLock/Decode, EFI_SUCCESS is returned although the region's
#  attributes were not actually modified.
