## @file
# This driver measures SMBIOS table to TPM.
#
# This driver is a sample driver to follow TCG platform specification to
# filter some fields in SMBIOS table.
#   - Platform configuration information that is automatically updated,
#     such as clock registers, and system unique information, such as
#     asset numbers or serial numbers, MUST NOT be measured into PCR [1],
#     or any other PCR.
# The OEM types are skipped and platform code can measure them by self if required.
#
# A platform may use its own policy to filter some fields in SMBIOS table.
