## @file
#  Runtime DXE part corresponding to SMM authenticated variable module.
#
#  This module installs variable arch protocol and variable write arch protocol to provide
#  variable service. This module need work together with SMM authenticated variable module.
#
#  Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
#  This driver will have external input - variable data.
#  This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issues such as
#  buffer overflow or integer overflow.
#    The whole SMM authentication variable design relies on the integrity of flash part and SMM.
#  which is assumed to be protected by platform.  All variable code and metadata in flash/SMM Memory
#  may not be modified without authorization. If platform fails to protect these resources,
#  the authentication service provided in this driver will be broken, and the behavior is undefined.
