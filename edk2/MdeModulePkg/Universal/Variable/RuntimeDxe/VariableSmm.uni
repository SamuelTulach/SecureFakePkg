// Provides SMM variable service.
//
// This module installs SMM variable protocol into SMM protocol database,
// which can be used by SMM driver, and installs SMM variable protocol
// into BS protocol database, which can be used to notify the SMM Runtime
// Dxe driver that the SMM variable service is ready.
// This module should be used with SMM Runtime DXE module together. The
// SMM Runtime DXE module would install variable arch protocol and variable
// write arch protocol based on SMM variable module.
//
// Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
// This driver will have external input - variable data and communicate buffer in SMM mode.
// This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issues such as
// buffer overflow or integer overflow.
