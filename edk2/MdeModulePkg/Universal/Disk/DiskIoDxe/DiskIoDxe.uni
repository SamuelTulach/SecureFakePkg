// /** @file
// Module that lays Disk I/O protocol on every Block I/O protocol.
//
// This module produces Disk I/O protocol to abstract the block accesses
// of the Block I/O protocol to a more general offset-length protocol
// to provide byte-oriented access to block media. It adds this protocol
// to any Block I/O interface that appears in the system that does not
// already have a Disk I/O protocol. File systems and other disk access
// code utilize the Disk I/O protocol.
