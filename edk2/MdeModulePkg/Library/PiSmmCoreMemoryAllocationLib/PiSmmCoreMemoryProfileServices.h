  Update SMRAM profile information.

  @param CallerAddress  Address of caller who call Allocate or Free.
  @param Action         This Allocate or Free action.
  @param MemoryType     Memory type.
                        EfiMaxMemoryType means the MemoryType is unknown.
  @param Size           Buffer size.
  @param Buffer         Buffer address.
  @param ActionString   String for memory profile action.
                        Only needed for user defined allocate action.

  @return EFI_SUCCESS           Memory profile is updated.
  @return EFI_UNSUPPORTED       Memory profile is unsupported,
                                or memory profile for the image is not required,
                                or memory profile for the memory type is not required.
  @return EFI_ACCESS_DENIED     It is during memory profile data getting.
  @return EFI_ABORTED           Memory profile recording is not enabled.
  @return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  No enough resource to update memory profile for allocate action.
  @return EFI_NOT_FOUND         No matched allocate info found for free action.
