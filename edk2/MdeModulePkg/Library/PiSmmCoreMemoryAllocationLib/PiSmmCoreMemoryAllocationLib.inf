# Memory Allocation Library instance dedicated to SMM Core.
# The implementation borrows the SMM Core Memory Allocation services as the primitive
# for memory allocation instead of using SMM System Table services in an indirect way.
# It is assumed that this library instance must be linked with SMM Cre in this package.
