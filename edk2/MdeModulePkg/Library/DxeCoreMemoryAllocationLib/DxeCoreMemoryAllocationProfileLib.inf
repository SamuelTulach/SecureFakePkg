# Memory Allocation/Profile Library instance dedicated to DXE Core.
# The implementation borrows the DxeCore Memory Allocation/profile services as the primitive
# for memory allocation/profile instead of using UEFI boot services or memory profile protocol in an indirect way.
# It is assumed that this library instance must be linked with DxeCore in this package.
