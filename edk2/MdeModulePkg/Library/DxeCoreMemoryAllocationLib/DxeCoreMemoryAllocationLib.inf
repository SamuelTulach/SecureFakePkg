# Memory Allocation Library instance dedicated to DXE Core.
# The implementation borrows the DxeCore Memory Allocation services as the primitive
# for memory allocation instead of using UEFI boot services in an indirect way.
# It is assumed that this library instance must be linked with DxeCore in this package.
