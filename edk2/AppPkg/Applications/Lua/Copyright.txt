Lua is designed, implemented, and maintained by a team at PUC-Rio, the
Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Lua was born and
raised in Tecgraf, formerly the Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio.
Lua is now housed at LabLua, a laboratory of the Department of Computer Science
of PUC-Rio.

The initial work to provide the UEFI implementation of Lua was done at
Emulex Corporation.

Some final packaging and build file "beautification" was done at
Intel Corporation.
