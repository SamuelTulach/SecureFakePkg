This directory contains various demonstrations of what you can do with
Python.  They were all written by me except where explicitly stated
otherwise -- in general, demos contributed by others ends up in the
../Contrib directory, unless I think they're of utmost general
importance (like Matt Conway's Tk demos).

A fair number of utilities that are useful when while developing
Python code can be found in the ../Tools directory -- some of these
can also be considered good examples of how to write Python code.

Finally, in order to save disk space and net bandwidth, not all
subdirectories listed here are distributed.  They are listed just
in case I change my mind about them.
