/** The realpath() function shall derive, from the pathname pointed to by
    file_name, an absolute pathname that names the same file, whose resolution
    does not involve '.', '..', or symbolic links.

    The generated pathname shall be stored as a null-terminated string, up to a
    maximum of {PATH_MAX} bytes, in the buffer pointed to by resolved_name.

    If resolved_name is a null pointer, the behavior of realpath() is
    implementation-defined.

  @param[in] file_name            The filename to convert.
  @param[in,out] resolved_name    The resultant name.

  @retval NULL                    An error occured.
  @return resolved_name.
