/** @file
  Definitions for memory allocation routines: calloc, malloc, realloc, free.

  The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to the
  calloc, malloc, and realloc functions is unspecified.  The pointer returned
  if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to
  a pointer of any type of object and then used to access such an object or an
  array of such objects in the space allocated (until the space is explicitly
  freed or reallocated).  Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an
  object disjoint from any other object.  The pointer returned points to the
  start (lowest byte address) of the allocated space.  If the space can not be
  allocated, a null pointer is returned.  If the size of the space requested
  is zero, the behavior is implementation-defined; the value returned shall be
  either a null pointer or a unique pointer.  The value of a pointer that
  refers to freed space is indeterminate.

/** The UEFI functions do not provide a way to determine the size of an
    allocated region of memory given just a pointer to the start of that
    region.  Since this is required for the implementation of realloc,
    the memory head structure, CPOOL_HEAD, containing the necessary
    information is prepended to the requested space.

    The order of members is important.  This structure is 8-byte aligned,
    as per the UEFI specification for memory allocation functions.  By
    specifying Size as a 64-bit value and placing it immediately before
    Data, it ensures that Data will always be 8-byte aligned.

    On IA32 systems, this structure is 24 bytes long, excluding Data.
    On X64  systems, this structure is 32 bytes long, excluding Data.

    - valid   NewSize >= OldSize    Returns malloc(NewSize) with Oldsize bytes copied from Ptr
    - valid   NewSize <  OldSize    Returns new buffer with Oldsize bytes copied from Ptr
