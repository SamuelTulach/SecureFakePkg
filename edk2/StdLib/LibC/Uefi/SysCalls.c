/** The fcntl() function shall perform the operations described below on open
    files. The fildes argument is a file descriptor.

    The available values for cmd are defined in <fcntl.h> and are as follows:
      - F_DUPFD - Return a new file descriptor which shall be the lowest
                  numbered available (that is, not already open) file
                  descriptor greater than or equal to the third argument, arg,
                  taken as an integer of type int. The new file descriptor
                  shall refer to the same open file description as the original
                  file descriptor, and shall share any locks. The FD_CLOEXEC
                  flag associated with the new file descriptor shall be cleared
                  to keep the file open across calls to one of the exec functions.
      - F_GETFD - Get the file descriptor flags defined in <fcntl.h> that are
                  associated with the file descriptor fildes. File descriptor
                  flags are associated with a single file descriptor and do not
                  affect other file descriptors that refer to the same file.
      - F_SETFD - Set the file descriptor flags defined in <fcntl.h>, that are
                  associated with fildes, to the third argument, arg, taken
                  as type int. If the FD_CLOEXEC flag in the third argument
                  is 0, the file shall remain open across the exec
                  functions; otherwise, the file shall be closed upon
                  successful execution of one of the exec functions.
      - F_GETFL - Get the file status flags and file access modes, defined in
                  <fcntl.h>, for the file description associated with fildes.
                  The file access modes can be extracted from the return
                  value using the mask O_ACCMODE, which is defined in
                  <fcntl.h>. File status flags and file access modes are
                  associated with the file description and do not affect
                  other file descriptors that refer to the same file with
                  different open file descriptions.
      - F_SETFL - Set the file status flags, defined in <fcntl.h>, for the file
                  description associated with fildes from the corresponding
                  bits in the third argument, arg, taken as type int. Bits
                  corresponding to the file access mode and the file creation
                  flags, as defined in <fcntl.h>, that are set in arg shall
                  be ignored. If any bits in arg other than those mentioned
                  here are changed by the application, the result is unspecified.
      - F_GETOWN -  If fildes refers to a socket, get the process or process group
                  ID specified to receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band
                  data is available. Positive values indicate a process ID;
                  negative values, other than -1, indicate a process group
                  ID. If fildes does not refer to a socket, the results are
                  unspecified.
      - F_SETOWN -  If fildes refers to a socket, set the process or process
                  group ID specified to receive SIGURG signals when
                  out-of-band data is available, using the value of the third
                  argument, arg, taken as type int. Positive values indicate
                  a process ID; negative values, other than -1, indicate a
                  process group ID. If fildes does not refer to a socket, the
                  results are unspecified.

    The fcntl() function shall fail if:

    [EBADF]       The fildes argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
    [EINVAL]      The cmd argument is invalid, or the cmd argument is F_DUPFD
                  and arg is negative or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.
    [EMFILE]      The argument cmd is F_DUPFD and {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors
                  are currently open in the calling process, or no file
                  descriptors greater than or equal to arg are available.
    [EOVERFLOW]   One of the values to be returned cannot be represented correctly.

    @param[in]      fildes    Descriptor for the file to be controlled.
    @param[in]      cmd       Command to be acted upon.
    @param[in,out]  ...       Optional additional parameters as required by cmd.

    @return   Upon successful completion, the value returned shall depend on
              cmd as follows:
                - F_DUPFD - A new file descriptor.
                - F_GETFD - Value of flags defined in <fcntl.h>. The return value
                            shall not be negative.
                - F_SETFD - Value other than -1.
                - F_GETFL - Value of file status flags and access modes. The return
                            value is not negative.
                - F_SETFL - Value other than -1.
                - F_GETOWN  - Value of the socket owner process or process group;
                            this will not be -1.
                - F_SETOWN - Value other than -1.
              Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and errno set to indicate the error.

/** Reposition a file's read/write offset.

    The lseek() function repositions the offset of the file descriptor fildes
    to the argument offset according to the directive how.  The argument
    fildes must be an open file descriptor.  lseek() repositions the file
    pointer fildes as follows:

      - If how is SEEK_SET, the offset is set to offset bytes.

      - If how is SEEK_CUR, the offset is set to its current location
        plus offset bytes.

      - If how is SEEK_END, the offset is set to the size of the file
        plus offset bytes.

    The lseek() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of
    the existing end-of-file of the file.  If data is later written at this
    point, subsequent reads of the data in the gap return bytes of zeros
    (until data is actually written into the gap).

    ated with such a device is undefined.

    @param[in]  offset    Value to adjust the file position by.
    @param[in]  how       How the file position is to be adjusted.

    @return   Upon successful completion, lseek() returns the resulting offset
              location as measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.

/** Open a file.
    The open() function establishes the connection between a file and a file
    descriptor.  It creates an open file description that refers to a file
    and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file
    descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file.

    The open() function returns a file descriptor for the named file that is
    the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process. The open
    file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor shall not
    share it with any other process in the system.

    The file offset used to mark the current position within the file is set
    to the beginning of the file.

    The EFI ShellOpenFileByName() function is used to perform the low-level
    file open operation.  The primary task of open() is to translate from the
    flags used in the <stdio.h> environment to those used by the EFI function.

    The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description
    are set according to the value of oflags.

    Values for oflags are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from
    the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>. Applications shall specify
    exactly one of { O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_WRONLY } in the value of oflags.
    Any combination of { O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND, O_CREAT, O_TRUNC, O_EXCL } may
    also be specified in oflags.

    The only valid flag combinations for ShellOpenFileByName() are:
      - Read
      - Read/Write
      - Create/Read/Write

    Values for mode specify the access permissions for newly created files.
    The mode value is saved in the FD to indicate permissions for further operations.

    O_RDONLY      -- flags = EFI_FILE_MODE_READ -- this is always done
    O_WRONLY      -- flags |= EFI_FILE_MODE_WRITE
    O_RDWR        -- flags |= EFI_FILE_MODE_WRITE -- READ is already set

    O_NONBLOCK    -- ignored
    O_APPEND      -- Seek to EOF before every write
    O_CREAT       -- flags |= EFI_FILE_MODE_CREATE
    O_TRUNC       -- delete first then create new
    O_EXCL        -- if O_CREAT is also set, open will fail if the file already exists.

    @param[in]    Path      The path argument points to a pathname naming the
                            object to be opened.
    @param[in]    oflags    File status flags and file access modes of the
                            open file description.
    @param[in]    mode      File access permission bits as defined in
                            <sys/stat.h>.  Only used if a file is created
                            as a result of the open.

    @return     Upon successful completion, open() opens the file and returns
                a non-negative integer representing the lowest numbered
                unused file descriptor. Otherwise, open returns -1 and sets
                errno to indicate the error. If a negative value is
                returned, no files are created or modified.
                  - EMFILE - No file descriptors available -- Max number already open.
                  - EINVAL - Bad value specified for oflags or mode.
                  - ENOMEM - Failure allocating memory for internal buffers.
                  - EEXIST - File exists and open attempted with (O_EXCL | O_CREAT) set.
                  - EIO - UEFI failure.  Check value in EFIerrno.

/** Read from a file.

    The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file
    associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed
    to by buf.

    Before any action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the
    read() function may detect and return errors as described below. In the
    absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read()
    function shall return zero and have no other results.

    On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read()
    shall start at a position in the file given by the file offset associated
    with fildes. The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes
    actually read.

    Files that do not support seeking - for example, terminals - always read
    from the current position. The value of a file offset associated with
    such a file is undefined.

    No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the
    starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned.

    The read() function reads data previously written to a file. If any
    portion of a regular file prior to the end-of-file has not been written,
    read() shall return bytes with value 0. For example, lseek() allows the
    file offset to be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If data
    is later written at this point, subsequent reads in the gap between the
    previous end of data and the newly written data shall return bytes with
    value 0 until data is written into the gap.

    Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, read() shall
    mark for update the st_atime field of the file, and shall return the
    number of bytes read. This number shall never be greater than nbyte. The
    value returned may be less than nbyte if the number of bytes left in the
    file is less than nbyte, if the read() request was interrupted by a
    signal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer
    than nbyte bytes immediately available for reading. For example, a read()
    from a file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of data.

    If fildes does not refer to a directory, the function reads the requested
    number of bytes from the file at the file's current position and returns
    them in buf. If the read goes beyond the end of the file, the read
    length is truncated to the end of the file. The file's current position is
    increased by the number of bytes returned.

    If fildes refers to a directory, the function reads the directory entry at
    the file's current position and returns the entry in buf. If buf
    is not large enough to hold the current directory entry, then
    errno is set to EBUFSIZE, EFIerrno is set to EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, and the
    current file position is not updated. The size of the buffer needed to read
    the entry will be returned as a negative number. On success, the current
    position is updated to the next directory entry. If there are no more
    directory entries, the read returns a zero-length buffer.
    EFI_FILE_INFO is the structure returned as the directory entry.

    @param[in]    fildes  Descriptor of the file to be read.
    @param[out]   buf     Pointer to location in which to store the read data.
    @param[in]    nbyte   Maximum number of bytes to be read.

    @return   Upon successful completion, read() returns a non-negative integer
              indicating the number of bytes actually read. Otherwise, the
              functions return a negative value and sets errno to indicate the
              error.  If errno is EBUFSIZE, the absolute value of the
              return value indicates the size of the buffer needed to read
              the directory entry.

/** Write data to a file.

    This function writes the specified number of bytes to the file at the current
    file position. The current file position is advanced the actual number of bytes
    written. Partial writes only occur when there has been a data error during
    the write attempt (such as "volume space full").  The file is automatically
    grown to hold the data if required.

    Direct writes to opened directories are not supported.

    If fildes refers to a terminal device, isatty() returns TRUE, a partial write
    will occur if a NULL or EOF character is encountered before n characters have
    been written.  Characters inserted due to line-end translations or TAB
    expansion will not be counted.  Unconvertable characters are translated into
    the UEFI character BLOCKELEMENT_LIGHT_SHADE.

    Since the UEFI console device works on wide characters, the buffer is assumed
    to contain a byte-oriented multi-byte character stream which is then
    translated to wide characters using the mbtowc() functions.  The resulting
    wide character stream is what is actually sent to the UEFI console.

    Although both text and binary wide-oriented streams are conceptually
    sequences of wide characters, the external file associated with a
    wide-oriented stream is a sequence of multibyte characters,
    generalized as follows:
      - Multibyte encodings within files may contain embedded null bytes
        (unlike multibyte encodings valid for use internal to the program).
      - A file need not begin nor end in the initial shift state.

    @param[in]  fd      Descriptor of file to be written to.
    @param[in]  buf     Pointer to data to write to the file.
    @param[in]  nbyte   Number of bytes to be written to the file.

    @retval   >=0   Number of bytes actually written to the file.
    @retval   <0    An error occurred.  More data is provided by errno.
