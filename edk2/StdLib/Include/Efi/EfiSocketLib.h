  Send data using a network connection.

  This routine calls the network specific layer to queue the data
  for transmission.  Eventually the buffer will reach the head of
  the queue and will get transmitted over the network.  For datagram
  sockets there is no guarantee that the data reaches the application
  running on the remote system.

  The ::sendto routine calls this routine to send data to the remote
  system.  Note that ::send and ::write are layered on top of ::sendto.

  @param [in] pSocketProtocol Address of an ::EFI_SOCKET_PROTOCOL structure.
  
  @param [in] Flags           Message control flags
  
  @param [in] BufferLength    Length of the the buffer
  
  @param [in] pBuffer         Address of a buffer containing the data to send
  
  @param [in] pDataLength     Address to receive the number of data bytes sent

  @param [in] pAddress        Network address of the remote system address

  @param [in] AddressLength   Length of the remote network address structure

  @param [out] pErrno         Address to receive the errno value upon completion.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS - Socket data successfully queued for transmit
