  Accept a network connection.

  This routine calls the network specific layer to remove the next
  connection from the FIFO.

  The ::accept calls this routine to poll for a network
  connection to the socket.  When a connection is available
  this routine returns the ::EFI_SOCKET_PROTOCOL structure address
  associated with the new socket and the remote network address
  if requested.

  @param [in] pSocketProtocol Address of the ::EFI_SOCKET_PROTOCOL structure.

                              network address.

  @param [in, out] pSockAddrLength  Length in bytes of the address buffer.
                                    On output specifies the length of the
                                    remote network address.

  Bind a name to a socket.

  The ::bind routine calls this routine to connect a name

  @param [in] pSocketProtocol Address of the ::EFI_SOCKET_PROTOCOL structure.

  @param [in] pSockAddr Address of a sockaddr structure that contains the
                        connection point on the local machine.  An IPv4 address
                        of INADDR_ANY specifies that the connection is made to
                        all of the network stacks on the platform.  Specifying a
                        specific IPv4 address restricts the connection to the
                        network stack supporting that address.  Specifying zero
                        for the port causes the network layer to assign a port
                        number from the dynamic range.  Specifying a specific
                        port number causes the network layer to use that port.
