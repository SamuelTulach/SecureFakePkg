/** @file
  The header <stdlib.h> declares five types and several functions of general
  utility, and defines several macros.

  The files stddef.h and stdlib.h are "catch all" headers for definitions and declarations
  that don't fit well in the other headers.  There are two separate header files because
  the contents of <stddef.h> are valid in both freestanding and hosted environment, while the
  header <stdlib.h> contains elements that are only valid in a hosted environment.

  The following macros are defined in this file:<BR>
  @verbatim
    EXIT_FAILURE    An expression indicating application failure, used as an argument to exit().
    EXIT_SUCCESS    An expression indicating application success, used as an argument to exit().
    RAND_MAX        The maximum value returned by the rand function.
    MB_CUR_MAX      Maximum number of bytes in a multibyte character for the current locale.
    ATEXIT_MAX      Maximum number of routines that may be registered by the atexit function.
  @endverbatim

  The following types are defined in this file:<BR>
  @verbatim
    size_t      Unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator.
    wchar_t     The type of a wide character.
    div_t       Type of the value returned by the div function.
    ldiv_t      Type of the value returned by the ldiv function.
    lldiv_t     Type of the value returned by the lldiv function.

/** The strtol, strtoll, strtoul, and strtoull functions convert the initial
    portion of the string pointed to by nptr to long int, long long int,
    unsigned long int, and unsigned long long int representation, respectively.
    First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial,
    possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by the
    isspace function), a subject sequence resembling an integer represented in
    some radix determined by the value of base, and a final string of one or
    more unrecognized characters, including the terminating null character of
    the input string. Then, they attempt to convert the subject sequence to an
    integer, and return the result.

    If the value of base is zero, the expected form of the subject sequence is
    that of an integer constant, optionally preceded
    by a plus or minus sign, but not including an integer suffix. If the value
    of base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), the expected form of the subject
    sequence is a sequence of letters and digits representing an integer with
    the radix specified by base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign,
    but not including an integer suffix. The letters from a (or A) through z
    (or Z) are ascribed the values 10 through 35; only letters and digits whose
    ascribed values are less than that of base are permitted. If the value of
    base is 16, the characters 0x or 0X may optionally precede the sequence of
    letters and digits, following the sign if present.

    The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the
    input string, starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of
    the expected form. The subject sequence contains no characters if the input
    string is empty or consists entirely of white space, or if the first
    non-white-space character is other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.

    If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of base is
    zero, the sequence of characters starting with the first digit is
    interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has the
    expected form and the value of base is between 2 and 36, it is used as the
    base for conversion, ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If
    the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value resulting from the
    conversion is negated (in the return type). A pointer to the final string
    is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is
    not a null pointer.

    In other than the "C" locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence
    forms may be accepted.

    If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no
    conversion is performed; the value of nptr is stored in the object pointed
    to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer.
