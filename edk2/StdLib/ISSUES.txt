 13:  EFIAPI usage                                      2013-01-15   Understood
      Mismatch between functions declared EFIAPI but not defined EFIAPI.

 14:  EFIAPI usage                                      2013-01-15   Understood
      Function pointer type PFN_NET_CONFIGURE is NOT defined as EFIAPI but is
      used to point to EFIAPI functions.  This causes conflicts and results in
      improper operation.

 15:  Build Error                                       2013-09-20   Open
      Predicates in ns_addr.c and res_mkupdate.c need to also include explicit
      comparisons if an assignment side-effect is used.  Otherwise a warning
      will be generated which is promoted to a fatal error.

  3:  Usage Clarification                                     2012   Document
      Clarify that the current StdLib may not be used for developing drivers.

  5:  Error message Quality during execution                  2012   Verified
      Performing filesystem operations when a filesystem driver has not been
      linked into the application results in hangs or error messages that are
      misleading or unclear as to the cause.

  6:  Application error return                                2012   Verified
      On error, applications will sometimes return large positive numbers.

  9:  chdir/cwd not in EFI Shell                              2012   Understood
      The chdir and getcwd functions only work if one is using the UEFI Shell.

 10:  No current volume/directory at app. startup.            2012   Understood
      If the Shell does not have a current volume or directory, file operations
      may hang or fail.

 12:  Differentiate between binary and text streams.     Aug. 2013   Understood
      Implement differentiated text streams as specified by section 7.19.2 Streams,
      of the C standard.

 16:  Build Error                                       2013-08-12   Understood
      LibC/Stdio/vsnprintf_ss.c:145: (error) Uninitialized variable: n
      _DIAGASSERT expressions not appropriate for the UEFI environment.
