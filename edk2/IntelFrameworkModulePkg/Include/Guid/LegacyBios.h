  Defines a Tag GUID used to mark a UEFI legacy BIOS thunk driver based
  on legacy BIOS services and legacy option ROM. This Tag GUID must be installed on
  the ImageHandle of any module that follows the EFI Driver Model and uses
  the Int86() or FarCall() services of the Legacy Bios Protocol to produce
  a standard UEFI I/O Protocol.
