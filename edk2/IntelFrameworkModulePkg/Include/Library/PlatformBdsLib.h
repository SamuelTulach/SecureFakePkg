  This routine is called to see if there are any capsules we need to process.

  capsule HOBS and produce firmware volumes for them via the DXE service.
  Then call the dispatcher to dispatch drivers from them. Finally, check
  the status of the updates.

  This function should be called by BDS in case we need to do some
  sort of processing even if there is no capsule to process. We
  need to do this if an earlier update went away and we need to
  clear the capsule variable so on the next reset PEI does not see it and
  think there is a capsule available.
