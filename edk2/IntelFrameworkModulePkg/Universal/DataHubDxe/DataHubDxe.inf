#  This driver initializes and installs the Data Hub protocol.
#
#  The data hub is a volatile database that is intended as the major focus for the accumulation of
#  manageability data.T he hub is fed by "producers" with chunks of data in a defined format.
#  Consumers may then extract the data in temporal "log" order.As an example, progress codes might
#  be recorded in the data hub for future processing.Ot her data contributed to the data hub might
#  include, for example, statistics on enumerated items such as memory, add-in buses, and add-in
#  cards and data on errors encountered during boot (for example, the system did not boot off the
#  network because the cable was not plugged in).
#  Some classes of data have defined formats.For example, the amount of memory in the system is
#  reported in a standard format so that consumers can be written to extract the data.O ther data is
#  system specific.For example, additional detail on errors might be specific to the driver that
#  discovered the error.The consumer might be a driver that tabularizes data from the data hub,
#  providing a mechanism for the raw data to be made available to the OS for post-processing by
#  OS-based applications.
#  The intent of the data hub is for drivers that enumerate and configure parts of the system to report
#  their discoveries to the data hub.This data can then be extracted by other drivers that report those
#  discoveries using standard manageability interfaces such as SMBIOS and Intelligent Platform
#  Management Interface (IPMI).The alternative to a data-hub-like architecture is to require all
#  drivers to be aware of all reporting formats.
