#  Produces Framework Legacy Region Protocol.
#
#  This generic implementation of the Legacy Region Protocol does not actually
#  perform any lock/unlock operations.  This module may be used on platforms
#  that do not provide HW locking of the legacy memory regions.  It can also
#  be used as a template driver for implementing the Legacy Region Protocol on
#  a platform that does support HW locking of the legacy memory regions.
