  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of a driver in the form of a
  Unicode string. If the driver specified by This has a user readable name in
  the language specified by Language, then a pointer to the driver name is
  returned in DriverName, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned. If the driver specified
  by This does not support the language specified by Language,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

  @param  This[in]              A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME2_PROTOCOL or
                                EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param  Language[in]          A pointer to a Null-terminated ASCII string
                                array indicating the language. This is the

                                in RFC 4646 or ISO 639-2 language code format.

  @param  DriverName[out]       A pointer to the Unicode string to return.
                                This Unicode string is the name of the

                                specified by Language.
