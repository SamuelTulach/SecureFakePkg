Routine Description:
  This service is called from Index == 0 until it returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  It allows discontinuous memory regions to be supported by the emulator.
  It uses gSystemMemory[] and gSystemMemoryCount that were created by
  parsing the Windows environment variable EFI_MEMORY_SIZE.
  The size comes from the varaible and the address comes from the call to
  WinNtOpenFile. 

Arguments:
  Index      - Which memory region to use
  MemoryBase - Return Base address of memory region
  MemorySize - Return size in bytes of the memory region

Returns:
  EFI_SUCCESS - If memory region was mapped
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED - If Index is not supported
