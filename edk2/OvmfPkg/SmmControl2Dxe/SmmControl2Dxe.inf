## @file
# A DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER providing synchronous SMI activations via the
# EFI_SMM_CONTROL2_PROTOCOL.
#
# We expect the PEI phase to have covered the following:
# - ensure that the underlying QEMU machine type be Q35
#   (responsible: OvmfPkg/SmmAccess/SmmAccessPei.inf)
# - ensure that the ACPI PM IO space be configured
#   (responsible: OvmfPkg/PlatformPei/PlatformPei.inf)
#
# Our own entry point is responsible for confirming the SMI feature and for
# configuring it.
