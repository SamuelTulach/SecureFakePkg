## @file
#  Instance of I/O Library using compiler intrinsics.
#
#  I/O Library that uses compiler intrinsics to perform IN and OUT instructions
#  for IA-32 and x64.  On IPF, I/O port requests are translated into MMIO requests.
#  MMIO requests are forwarded directly to memory.  For EBC, I/O port requests
#  ASSERT().
