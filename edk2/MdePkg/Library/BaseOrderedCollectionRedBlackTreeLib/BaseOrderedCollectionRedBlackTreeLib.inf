## @file
#  An OrderedCollectionLib instance that provides a red-black tree
#  implementation, and allocates and releases tree nodes with
#  MemoryAllocationLib.
#
#  This library instance is useful when a fast associative container is needed.
#  Worst case time complexity is O(log n) for Find(), Next(), Prev(), Min(),
#  Max(), Insert(), and Delete(), where "n" is the number of elements in the
#  tree. Complete ordered traversal takes O(n) time.
#
#  The implementation is also useful as a fast priority queue.
