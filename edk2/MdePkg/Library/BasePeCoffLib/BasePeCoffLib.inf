#  PE/COFF Loader Library implementation.
#  The IPF version library supports loading IPF and EBC PE/COFF image.
#  The IA32 version library support loading IA32, X64 and EBC PE/COFF images.
#  The X64 version library support loading IA32, X64 and EBC PE/COFF images.
#
#  Caution: This module requires additional review when modified.
#  This library will have external input - PE/COFF image.
#  This external input must be validated carefully to avoid security issue like
#  buffer overflow, integer overflow.
