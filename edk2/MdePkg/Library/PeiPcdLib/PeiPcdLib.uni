#string STR_MODULE_DESCRIPTION          #language en-US "There are two PCD PPIs as follows: 1) PCD_PPI: It is EDKII implementation which support Dynamic/DynamicEx Pcds. 2) EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI: It is defined by PI Specification 1.2, Vol 3, which only support dynamicEx type Pcd. For dynamicEx type PCD, it is compatible between PCD_PPI and EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI. This library instance uses the PCD_PPI to handle dynamic PCD request and use EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI to handle dynamicEx type PCD. This library instance assumes that PCD_PPI and EFI_PEI_PCD_PPI are both installed early. The PCD Library that uses the PCD PPI to access Dynamic and DynamicEx PCD entries."
