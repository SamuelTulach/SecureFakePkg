// Instance of Timer Library only using CPU resources.
//
// Timer Library that only uses CPU resources to provide calibrated delays
// on IA-32, x64, and IPF.
// Note: A driver of type DXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER and DXE_SMM_DRIVER can use this TimerLib
// in their initialization without any issues. They only have to be careful in
// the implementation of runtime services and SMI handlers.
// Because CPU Local APIC and ITC could be programmed by OS, it cannot be
// used by SMM drivers and runtime drivers, ACPI timer is recommended for SMM
// drivers and runtime drivers.
//
// Note that for IA-32 and x64, this library only supports xAPIC mode. If x2APIC
// support is desired, the SecPeiDxeTimerLibUefiCpu library can be used.
