  Implementation of SetJump() and LongJump() on EBC.

  SetJump() and LongJump() are not currently supported for the EBC processor type.
  Implementation for EBC just returns 0 for SetJump(), and ASSERT() for LongJump().

/**
  Saves the current CPU context that can be restored with a call to LongJump() and returns 0.

  Saves the current CPU context in the buffer specified by JumpBuffer and returns 0.  The initial
  call to SetJump() must always return 0.  Subsequent calls to LongJump() cause a non-zero
  value to be returned by SetJump().

  If JumpBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  For IPF CPUs, if JumpBuffer is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, then ASSERT().

  @param  JumpBuffer    A pointer to CPU context buffer.

  @retval 0 Indicates a return from SetJump().

  Restores the CPU context that was saved with SetJump().

  Restores the CPU context from the buffer specified by JumpBuffer.

  @param  Value         The value to return when the SetJump() context is restored.
