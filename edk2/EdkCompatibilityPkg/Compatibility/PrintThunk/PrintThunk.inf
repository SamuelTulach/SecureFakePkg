# Module produces EDK gEfiPrintProtocolGuid for backward compatibility support.
#
# EDK II retires old EDK Print Protocol and this module produces
# gEfiPrintProtocolGuid based on PrintLib:
# 1) If it links against BasePrintLib in MdePkg, it produces gEfiPrintProtocolGuid
#    without any prerequisites.
# 2) If it links against DxePrintLibPrint2Protocol in MdeModulePkg, it produces
#    gEfiPrintProtocolGuid on top of gEfiPrint2ProtocolGuid.
