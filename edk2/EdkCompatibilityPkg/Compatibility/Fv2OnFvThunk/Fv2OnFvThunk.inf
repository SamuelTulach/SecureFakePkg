# Module produce FV2 on top of FV.

# UEFI PI specification supersedes Inte's Framework Specification.
# EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_PROTOCOL defined in Intel Framework Pkg is replaced by
# EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL in MdePkg.
# This module produces FV2 on top of FV. This module is used on platform when both of
# these two conditions are true:
# 1) Framework module producing FV is present
# 2) And the rest of modules on the platform consume FV2
