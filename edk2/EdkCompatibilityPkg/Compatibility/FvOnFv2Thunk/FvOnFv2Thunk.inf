# Module produce FV on top of FV2.

# UEFI PI specification supersedes Inte's Framework Specification.
# EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_PROTOCOL defined in Intel Framework Pkg is replaced by
# EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME2_PROTOCOL in MdePkg.
# This module produces FV on top of FV2. This module is used on platform when both of
# these two conditions are true:
# 1) Framework module consuming FV is present
# 2) And the platform only produces FV2
