Routine Description:

The implementation of Customized SetCompressionType().

Arguments:
  Type        - The type if compression.
    
Returns:
    
  EFI_SUCCESS           - The type has been set.
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED       - This type is unsupported.

Routine Description:

  The implementation of Customized GetInfo().

Arguments:

  Source      - The source buffer containing the compressed data.
  SrcSize     - The size of source buffer
  DstSize     - The size of destination buffer.
  ScratchSize - The size of scratch buffer.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS           - The size of destination buffer and the size of scratch buffer are successfully retrieved.
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - The source data is corrupted

Routine Description:

  The implementation of Customized Decompress().

Arguments:

  This        - The protocol instance pointer
  Source      - The source buffer containing the compressed data.
  SrcSize     - The size of source buffer
  Destination - The destination buffer to store the decompressed data
  DstSize     - The size of destination buffer.
  Scratch     - The buffer used internally by the decompress routine. This  buffer is needed to store intermediate data.
  ScratchSize - The size of scratch buffer.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS           - Decompression is successfull
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER - The source data is corrupted

Routine Description:

  The Customized compression routine.

Arguments:

  SrcBuffer   - The buffer storing the source data
  SrcSize     - The size of source data
  DstBuffer   - The buffer to store the compressed data
  DstSize     - On input, the size of DstBuffer; On output,
                the size of the actual compressed data.

Returns:

  EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  - The DstBuffer is too small. In this case,
                          DstSize contains the size needed.
  EFI_SUCCESS           - Compression is successful.
