Module Name:

  EfiSpec.h

Abstract:

  EFI master include file.

  This is the main include file for EFI components. There should be
  no defines or macros added to this file, other than the EFI version 
  information already in this file.

  Don't add include files to the list for convenience, only add things
  that are architectural. Don't add Protocols or GUID include files here
