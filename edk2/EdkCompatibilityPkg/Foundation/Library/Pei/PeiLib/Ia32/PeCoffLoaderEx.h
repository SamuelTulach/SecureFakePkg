Routine Description:

  Performs an IA-32 specific relocation fixup

Arguments:

  Reloc      - Pointer to the relocation record

  Fixup      - Pointer to the address to fix up

  FixupData  - Pointer to a buffer to log the fixups

  Adjust     - The offset to adjust the fixup

Returns:

  EFI_UNSUPPORTED   - relocate unsupported

BOOLEAN
PeCoffLoaderImageFormatSupported (
  IN  UINT16  Machine
  )
/*++
Routine Description:

  Returns TRUE if the machine type of PE/COFF image is supported. Supported 
  does not mean the image can be executed it means the PE/COFF loader supports
  loading and relocating of the image type. It's up to the caller to support
  the entry point. 

  This function implies the basic PE/COFF loader/relocator supports IA32, EBC,
  & X64 images. Calling the entry point in a correct mannor is up to the 
  consumer of this library.

Arguments:

  Machine   - Machine type from the PE Header.

Returns:

  TRUE      - if this PE/COFF loader can load the image
  FALSE     - if this PE/COFF loader cannot load the image
