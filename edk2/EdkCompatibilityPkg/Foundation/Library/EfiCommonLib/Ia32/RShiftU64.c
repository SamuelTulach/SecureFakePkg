Module Name:

Abstract:

  64-bit right shift function for IA-32

Routine Description:
  This routine allows a 64 bit value to be right shifted by 32 bits and returns the 
  shifted value.
  Count is valid up 63. (Only Bits 0-5 is valid for Count)
Arguments:
  Operand - Value to be shifted
  Count   - Number of times to shift right.
 
Returns:

  Value shifted right identified by the Count.
