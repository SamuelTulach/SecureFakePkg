Routine Description:

  Initialize a basic mutual exclusion lock.   Each lock
  provides mutual exclusion access at it's task priority
  level.  Since there is no-premption (at any TPL) or
  multiprocessor support, acquiring the lock only consists
  of raising to the locks TPL.

  Note on a check build ASSERT()s are used to ensure proper
  lock usage.
    
Arguments:

  Lock        - The EFI_LOCK structure to initialize

  Priority    - The task priority level of the lock

    
Returns:

  An initialized Efi Lock structure.
