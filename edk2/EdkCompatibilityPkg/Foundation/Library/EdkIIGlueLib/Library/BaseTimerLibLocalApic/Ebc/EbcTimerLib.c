Module Name:

  EbcTimerLib.c
  
Abstract: 

  Timer Library functions built upon local APIC on IA32/x64.

  @bug Should use PCD to retrieve all the constants including index of
  the IA32_APIC_BASE MSR, the offsets of InitialCount, CorrentCount
  and DivideConfiguration.

  Retrieves the current value of a 64-bit free running performance counter.

  Retrieves the current value of a 64-bit free running performance counter. The
  counter can either count up by 1 or count down by 1. If the physical
  performance counter counts by a larger increment, then the counter values
  must be translated. The properties of the counter can be retrieved from
  GetPerformanceCounterProperties().

/**
  Retrieves the 64-bit frequency in Hz and the range of performance counter
  values.

  If StartValue is not NULL, then the value that the performance counter starts
  with immediately after is it rolls over is returned in StartValue. If
  EndValue is not NULL, then the value that the performance counter end with
  immediately before it rolls over is returned in EndValue. The 64-bit
  frequency of the performance counter in Hz is always returned. If StartValue
  is less than EndValue, then the performance counter counts up. If StartValue
  is greater than EndValue, then the performance counter counts down. For
  example, a 64-bit free running counter that counts up would have a StartValue
  of 0 and an EndValue of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. A 24-bit free running counter
  that counts down would have a StartValue of 0xFFFFFF and an EndValue of 0.

  @param  StartValue  The value the performance counter starts with when it
                      rolls over.
  @param  EndValue    The value that the performance counter ends with before
                      it rolls over.

  @return The frequency in Hz.
