Abstract: 

  ScanMem32() implementation.

--*/

#include "BaseMemoryLibInternal.h"

/**
  Scans a target buffer for a 32-bit value, and returns a pointer to the matching 32-bit value
  in the target buffer.

  This function searches target the buffer specified by Buffer and Length from the lowest
  address to the highest address for a 32-bit value that matches Value.  If a match is found,
  then a pointer to the matching byte in the target buffer is returned.  If no match is found,
  then NULL is returned.  If Length is 0, then NULL is returned.
  If Length > 0 and Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Buffer is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is not aligned on a 32-bit boundary, then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS ? Buffer + 1), then ASSERT(). 

  @param  Buffer      Pointer to the target buffer to scan.
  @param  Length      Number of bytes in Buffer to scan.
  @param  Value       Value to search for in the target buffer.

  @return A pointer to the matching byte in the target buffer or NULL otherwise.
